#Docker Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Docker must be installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, follow the instructions for your operating system here.
You should have basic knowledge of Docker and its concepts, such as containers and images.
Installation
Clone the repository containing the Dockerfile:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
Change into the directory where the Dockerfile is located:

bash
Copy code
cd repo
Build the Docker image:

Copy code
docker build -t image-name .
This will build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory. Replace image-name with a name that you want to use for the image. The . at the end specifies the current directory as the build context.

Run the Docker container:

css
Copy code
docker run -it -p 4000:80 image-name
This will run the Docker container and map port 4000 on the host to port 80 in the container. Replace image-name with the name you used in step 3. The -it flag starts the container in interactive mode and allocates a pseudo-TTY.

Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:4000.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter an error when building the image, check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing dependencies.

If you encounter an error when running the container, check the logs for the container to see if it contains any useful information. You can view the logs for a container with the following command:

python
Copy code
docker logs container-id
Replace container-id with the ID of the container that you're having trouble with.
